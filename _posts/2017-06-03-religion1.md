First post with real content on this page! I'm excited too, don't worry :)

I have been atheist since the beginning of time. My only encounters with a familial religion include hiding in fear from singing church hymns in a Chinese-Christian church not far from my house and gingerly bowing (磕头--Kētóu) at some Buddhist temple when I barely scraped the pre-teen years.
And so, aside from overhearing my parents' concerned prayers to a higher-up, most of my exposure to religion and spirituality came through my studies, which, as an egotistical youth, I of course scoffed at, because what use is an American textbook on teaching me about personal growth? 

It was in sophomore year of high school when I discovered the magical playground that is Reddit. I was able to develop my take on atheism beyond a rejection of a higher power; soon, I viewed religion as the culprit for society's shortcomings. At one point, I even denounced religion all-together, tauntingly asserting that religion has done no good for the world except slow down science and misguide people to "have faith" rather than to "take the reigns".

Lots of thinking and talking to people about their faith occured between then and now. More recently, I've decided that I want to actively expand my interface with religion and spirituality. I'm excited to say that this morning, amongst corn-fields and a 67.8% White population, I attended a Christian service! Introspection and thoughts are to come once they are more well-formed.
